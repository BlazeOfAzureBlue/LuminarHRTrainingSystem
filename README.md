Any warnings will automatically be attributed to the player and you can use the box to enter in a note of what they did. Notes do not require a selection and will just add to this box here:

In the above image, 3 players have been added to the playerlist and are shown in the rankings as so.

When no stats have been entered, the players will be ordered via when you inputted them.

Upon changing their stats, it can look like a variation of this:

Players will be automatically shifted around on the leaderboards depending on their **total** stats.
